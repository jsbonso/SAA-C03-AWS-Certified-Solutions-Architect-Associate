# SAA-C03 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate

## What’s New With SAA-C03 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam?
The AWS Training and Certification team recently announced that there’s yet another version release of its popular AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam will be released this August 30, 2022. Its new exam version would be SAA-C03.
Take note that the current version (SAA-C02) will only be available on August 29, 2022 so you still have time to recertify. The new SAA-C03 will be focused on Security, as shown on its official exam guide.

## History of the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam (SAA-C03)
Let’s take a look at the brief history first of the AWS Certified Solutions Architect exam.
It all began in 2013 when Amazon Web Services (AWS) began its Global Certification Program. Back then, its primary purpose of validating the technical skills and knowledge for building secure and reliable cloud-based applications using the AWS platform. Individuals can prove their AWS expertise to their current and future employers by successfully passing the AWS exam. This is the very first AWS certification that was launched followed by the other two role-based certifications: Systems Operations (SysOps) Administrator and Developer Associate later that year.

AWS launches the Professional and Specialty-level certifications which continuously expanded its certification program and since then, it has covered various domains such as machine learning, data analytics, networking, and many others. New and updated versions of the AWS certification exams are released on a regular basis to reflect the service changes and to include the brand-new knowledge areas.

An updated version of the AWS Certified Solutions Architect — Associate certification was launched after almost 5 years since its initial release. it was launched in February 2018 with an exam code of SAA-C01. And after two years, in March 2020, AWS released yet another version of the exam (SAA-C02).
Now, the SAA-C03 version for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect — Associate certification will be available on the 30th day of August 2022. Based on this trend, I’m assuming that the new version will be coming in 2024, with an exam code of SAA-C04, based on the exam convention.

## Is there an Exam Lab in SAA-C03, just like the SOA-C02 exam?
No, it doesn’t. You can confirm this on the official exam guide for the SAA-C03 exam.
This comes to me as a surprise since I initially thought that AWS will eventually include an Exam labs section on all of its new AWS Certifications team. Apparently, this is not the case as the new SAA-C03 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate and ANS-C01 AWS Certified Advanced Networking Specialty exams, Which will be released on the latter half of the year, don’t have any labs at all.
